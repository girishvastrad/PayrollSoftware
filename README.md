Payroll Management System is the system that maintains all the records of all employees and accountants of an organization.This System is per organization. At the front end of the system we have used NetBeans IDE in JAVA technology and WAMP server for maintaining databases. The project proceeds through a sequence of well designed JSP pages with validation to security, consistency, reliability, etc. Various users are provided which can perform various operations and tasks for which they have been authorized respectively. Basically there are 4 types of users: Employee, Accountant, HR Manager and Admin. Admin is fully authorized. While other users are authorized upto a certain level. Based on the user authorisation, users can perform various operations like Adding information of new Employee, Updating information, View list of employees, generate pay slip of particular employee, Generate report of the organization. This system is very user friendly and easily maintains all the information for all kind off users without any difficulties. The system also generates fault and error messages in case of invalid operation or the user enters invalid or wrong information for some particular cases. Various UML diagrams are prepared which may help a user to understand the flow of any module/task easily.
